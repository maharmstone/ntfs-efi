/*
 * The XPRESS compression format is an LZ77 and Huffman-code based algorithm.
 * That means it is fairly similar to LZX compression, but XPRESS is simpler, so
 * it is a little faster to compress and decompress.
 *
 * The XPRESS compression format is mostly documented in a file called "[MS-XCA]
 * Xpress Compression Algorithm".  In the MSDN library, it can currently be
 * found under Open Specifications => Protocols => Windows Protocols => Windows
 * Server Protocols => [MS-XCA] Xpress Compression Algorithm".  The format in
 * WIMs is specifically the algorithm labeled as the "LZ77+Huffman Algorithm"
 * (there apparently are some other versions of XPRESS as well).
 *
 * If you are already familiar with the LZ77 algorithm and Huffman coding, the
 * XPRESS format is fairly simple.  The compressed data begins with 256 bytes
 * that contain 512 4-bit integers that are the lengths of the symbols in the
 * Huffman code used for match/literal headers.  In contrast with more
 * complicated formats such as DEFLATE and LZX, this is the only Huffman code
 * that is used for the entirety of the XPRESS compressed data, and the codeword
 * lengths are not encoded with a pretree.
 *
 * The rest of the compressed data is Huffman-encoded symbols.  Values 0 through
 * 255 represent the corresponding literal bytes.  Values 256 through 511
 * represent matches and may require extra bits or bytes to be read to get the
 * match offset and match length.
 *
 * The trickiest part is probably the way in which literal bytes for match
 * lengths are interleaved in the bitstream.
 *
 * Also, a caveat--- according to Microsoft's documentation for XPRESS,
 *
 *	"Some implementation of the decompression algorithm expect an extra
 *	symbol to mark the end of the data.  Specifically, some implementations
 *	fail during decompression if the Huffman symbol 256 is not found after
 *	the actual data."
 *
 * This is the case with Microsoft's implementation in WIMGAPI, for example.  So
 * although our implementation doesn't currently check for this extra symbol,
 * compressors would be wise to add it.
